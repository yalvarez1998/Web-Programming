# Requirements for the Database for your personal projects
#### Checkpoint Due Nov 5

## How to submit
Add a sql file to your git repo. If you want my feedback, then also please add an mwb file containing a Model Diagram from MySqlWorkbench and a pdf printout of it. Otherwise, I will only take a cursory glance and spot check that you have the required parts.
Post a link to the exact file in BlackBoard

## Social graph style
For simplicity sake we will follow Instagram's style of social graph. Each person has followers (not quite friends). When you follow someone, they don't necessarily follow you back. You can (chose to) approve/allow each individual request to follow you.

## Questions your data should be able to answer
- How much time did I spend exercising each day this month?
- Did I work harder (not longer) / accomplish more than yesterday?
- Which exercises did I do each day?
- Where do I exercise most often?
- What type of exercise do I do most often?
- Who liked each exercise?
- Which follower has liked my stuff most often?
- Which person's stuff have I liked most often?
- Which exercises did my friends (those who I follow) do today?
- Where do my friends (those who I follow) exercise most often?

- Who do I follow?
- Who follows me?
- Who has requested to follow me?
- Who are some suggested people I should follow based on type of exercise, amount of time spent exercising, & skill level?

You can only answer questions about information that you have. So before you start collecting data, *think* "what questions will I need to answer? What information will I need? How will it need to be structured?"
