My passion for computers began when my parents bought my first desktop along with the monitor back in 2006 or 2007. It was a Dell desktop. It had all the features that we needed. It had games installed, it had Microsoft Office installed, etc. That is when I felt in love with technology and what can technology do to our community and how it affects to modern day science. As years passed, my understanding for computer has grown a lot. It wasnâ€™t until high school, where I began to do some research on how a normal size motherboard can function a big PC and what software are good for creating stuffs, and I got my first laptop, a Mac. I started teaching myself how to code using Code Academy and Khan Academy. I attended a 3-day workshop at Code Now where I learned Ruby and Swift. That is why I decided to major in Computer Science. I learned HTML and CSS in my Web Page Design class with Professor Min Chen. I used what I learned in class to create my own website from scratch using VS Code. You can check out my site at yitzhakalvarez.com. Now, I know Java, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, Swift, Ruby, and a little bit of Python. During my software engineering class, my team and I created an educational math suite with Java, JavaFX, and MySQL.
