  My passion for computers began when my parents bought my first desktop along with the monitor back in 2006 or 2007. It was a Dell desktop. It had all the features that we needed. It had games installed, it had Microsoft Office installed, etc. That is when I felt in love with technology and what can technology do to our community and how it affects to modern day science. As years passed, my understanding for computer has grown a lot. It wasn’t until high school, where I began to do some research on how a normal size motherboard can function a big PC and what software are good for creating stuffs, and I got my first laptop, a Mac. I started teaching myself how to code using Code Academy and Khan Academy. I attended a 3-day workshop at Code Now where I learned Ruby and Swift. That is why I decided to major in Computer Science. I learned HTML and CSS in my Web Page Design class with Professor Min Chen. I used what I learned in class to create my own website from scratch using VS Code. You can check out my site at yitzhakalvarez.com. Now, I know Java, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, Swift, Ruby, and a little bit of Python. During my software engineering class, my team and I created an educational math suite with Java, JavaFX, and MySQL.

  The Web Programming class is far the best class I’ve taken so far. Why? I want to learn more about web development, and I want to create something cool, and this class is the right class for it, and it is something that I would like to pursue later in life, as a Full Stack Developer or Software Engineer. All the new programming languages and servers that I’m going to learn in this class, I’m going to add it on my website or create a web application with it. I get to also use it when working at a tech company or in daily life. Or, I can use everything that I learn in this class and teach the low-income communities who lack off in STEM.
